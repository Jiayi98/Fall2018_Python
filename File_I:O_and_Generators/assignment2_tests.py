"""A few very basic tests for CS109 Python Assignment 2.

This does not test for all the requirements of the assignment! So make
sure you test it yourself.

Run this script using:
  python3.5 assignment2_tests.py
It should work if you are in the same directory as your assignment2.py
file. If this does not work you may want to try:
  PYTHONPATH=[directory containing assignment2.py] python3.5 assignment2_tests.py

This file contains UTF-8 encoded Unicode characters. This is really 
common these days and Python 3 is totally fine with it. If your editor
has problems with it you should fix your editor configuration.

Make sure you are not storing the entire dataset during loading or saving.
There is no portable way to test this, but you should make sure you
did it correctly since I will be testing it during grading. It should be

test suite.
