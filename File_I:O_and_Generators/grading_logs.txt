You used readlines(). I said it returned a generator. It doesn't. It returns a list. This makes it take up lots of memory. My bad. Not penalizing you for this.

-1 Building a generator before entering a loop over that generator just makes the syntax more confusing and doesn't gain anything.

Here is the output of the PyCodeStyle/PEP8 checker (showing the first instance of each issue).
This is does not effect your grade ON THIS ASSIGNMENT. However, I may add it as a grading criteria.

./zhoujiayi_4151694_46595295_assignment2-1.py:27:28: E231 missing whitespace after ','
    with open(filename, 'r',encoding="utf-8") as f:
                           ^
    Each comma, semicolon or colon should be followed by whitespace.

                                                                               ^
    Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.

    There are still many devices around that are limited to 80 character
    lines; plus, limiting windows to 80 characters makes it possible to have
    several windows side-by-side.  The default wrapping on such devices looks
    ugly.  Therefore, please limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
    For flowing long blocks of text (docstrings or comments), limiting the
    length to 72 characters is recommended.

    Reports error E501.
5       E231 missing whitespace after ','
1       E501 line too long (90 > 79 characters)
